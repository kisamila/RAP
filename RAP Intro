Introduction to SAP RAP
The ABAP RESTful Application Programming Model (RAP) is SAP's modern framework for developing efficient, scalable, and cloud-ready applications and APIs, primarily for SAP S/4HANA, SAP S/4HANA Cloud, and SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP) ABAP Environment. Introduced to replace traditional ABAP development approaches, RAP leverages RESTful principles to create transactional OData services that power SAP Fiori user interfaces and external integrations. It is designed to align with SAP's "clean core" strategy, enabling modification-free extensions and seamless upgrades.
RAP is built on a layered architecture:

Core Data Services (CDS): Defines semantically rich data models optimized for SAP HANA.
Behavior Definitions: Encapsulates business logic, validations, and transactional operations using ABAP.
Service Definitions and Bindings: Exposes CDS-based models and behaviors as OData services for consumption by Fiori apps or external systems.

Developers use the Eclipse-based ABAP Development Tools (ADT) to create RAP-based applications, which support both managed (SAP-handled persistence and draft capabilities) and unmanaged (custom persistence logic) scenarios. RAP integrates with SAP Fiori Elements for rapid UI generation and supports event-driven architectures via SAP Event Mesh, making it ideal for modern, modular enterprise applications. Its focus on standardization, extensibility, and HANA optimization positions RAP as a cornerstone for building future-proof SAP solutions.
